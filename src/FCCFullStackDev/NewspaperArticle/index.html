  <h2 class="headline">Mysterious Muggle Makes Magic Meringues</h2>
  <h3 class="sub-headline">A muggle has inadvertently created healing potion meringues</h3>
  <p class="author">by Mundungus Fletcher</p>
  <p class="text">In a bizarre twist that has left the wizarding community both baffled and amused, a Muggle baker
    in London has inadvertently created what appears to be a batch of healing potion-infused meringues. The
    confections, initially baked for a local charity event, were found to have remarkable restorative properties.
    Witnesses report that after consuming the meringues, minor ailments such as headaches and fatigue vanished
    almost instantly.</p>
  <p class="text">The Ministry of Magic has dispatched a team of Obliviators and Potions experts to investigate the
    incident. Preliminary findings suggest that the Muggle, unaware of the magical properties of her ingredients,
    may have stumbled upon a rare combination of herbs and essences with potent healing qualities. “It’s highly
    unusual for a Muggle to accidentally brew something so effective,” remarked Potions Master Horace Slughorn.
    “We’re looking into whether this was a fluke or if there’s more to it.”</p>
  <p class="text">While the Muggle in question remains oblivious to her accidental foray into potion-making, the
    wizarding world is abuzz with speculation. Could this be a sign of untapped magical potential in the non-magical
    community? Or is it simply a case of serendipity? For now, the Ministry has confiscated the remaining meringues
    for further study, leaving the Muggle baker with nothing but a puzzled expression and a very clean kitchen.</p>
