        <p>Python is a high level dynamically typed programming and is one of the most popular and accessible
            programming languages for beginners.</p>
        <p>Python is a highly human-readable language, with many advanced features such as memory management, type
            conversion and an extensive library of 1st and 3rd party modules to perform a wide range of tasks. Python is
            widely used for data science, mathematics and scripting. </p>

        <header>Getting Started</header>
        <p>To get started, install a python version from <a href="">the Python Website</a>. Choose a version that will
            meet your projects needs, a well-supported modern version is 3.10. Make sure to install the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A code editor or IDE</li>
            <li>A python interpreter</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Run the following command in the terminal to verify python has been installed:</p>
        <pre class="Python">
            python.exe
        </pre>
        <p>A python instance will open containing your version information and allow you to enter python commands to the
            terminal. See the following example for a machine with python 3.8.6 installed.</p>
        <pre class="Python">
            Python 3.8.6 (tags/v3.8.6:db45529, Sep 23 2020, 15:37:30) [MSC v.1927 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 <br>
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. <br>

        <header>Variables and Data Types</header>
        <p>Variables in Python are names assigned to objects in python that can be referenced in code. There are many
            base data types in Python, some of the most common are int, float and string. Python is dynamically typed,
            which means variables are assigned without providing the data type, the compiler will inference what the
            type should be from the data. Below is an example of assigning values of int, float and string.</p>
        <pre class="Python">
            my_int = 1
            my_float = 3.14
            my_string = "Hello World"
        </pre>
        <p>A list of the most commonly used base datatypes in Python is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Int</li>
            <li>Float</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>Dictionary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Python does not use a line terminator like c/c++ or javascript, the compiler infers the end of the line from
            whitespace and indentation. Python supports type casting, which converts one type to another based on
            context. For example, if you assign <code>my_int = 1</code> and then re-assign it to be <code>my_int =
                my_int + 1.5</code>, the variable will cast the original int to a float to add the float 1.5.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>Python functions are defined with the keyword <code class="Python">def</code> followed by the function name,
            then a set of parentheses containing the function input parameters followed by a colon. An example is shown
            below:</p>
        <pre class="Python">
            def print_my_name(my_name):
                print("Hello, my name is: " + my_name)
        </pre>
        <p>This function takes in the variable <code>my_name</code>, and prints out a string using that variable. The
            keyword <code>def</code> in the example is the keyword which tells the compiler that a function is to
            follow. There are many keywords in python, some include <code>class</code> for class declarations and <code>for</code>
            for loops.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>The most simple introduction example to a programming language is called the <i>Hello World</i> example. This
            is often a function that prints out the text "Hello World!" to the console. The python version of this is
            shown below:</p>
        <pre class="Python">
            print("Hello World!")
        </pre>
        <p>In python, this is very easy. This shows how simple python is to get started.</p>
